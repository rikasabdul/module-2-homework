My Experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository is an example of my experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I have worked hard to gain experience with the three coding languages and am confident in my abilities to create webpages and applications.

In this repository, you will find a few examples of projects I have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have included descriptions of each project to give you a better idea of the scope of my experience.
